How to make the touch shield work with your arduino!

1) Plug the shield into the board (I tested it with an UNO).
2) The pins on this board are a tiny bit bent.  Make sure the A0 lines up
   properly with A0 on the arduino, adn that TX and RX line up properly
   as well.

3) Open the .pde file in this folder in the arduino IDE
4) Compile and Upload it to your board by pressing ctrl-U or command-U 
   (if you are on a mac).  You can also click the right arrow icon (the s
    second icon in from the left).  Hover over it to see "upload" as a 
    description.
5) Open the serial monitor by pressing the magnifying glass icon at the
   top right of the arduino IDE (the arduino program).

6) Touch some spots on the board and see them appear on the serial monitor!
