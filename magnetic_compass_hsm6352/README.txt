HOW TO USE THE COMPASS

1) This compass operates on 5V.  Connect the VCC pin to the 5V on your arduino

2) Connect the GND pin to the GND pin on your arduino.

3) Connect a wire from SDA to ANALOG pin 4 on your arduino (make sure it is A4)

4) Connect a wire from SCL to ANALOG pin 5 on your arduino (make sure it is A5)

5) Run the sketch in this folder, and open the serial monitor from the Arduino program

6) To open the serial monitor, click the icon on the top right of the Arduino program
   (it looks a bit like a magnifying glass).

7) Look at the numbers, and it will tell you which direction the arrow is pointing!
   (The arrow is printed on the device)  
   0 is north, 90 is east, 180 is south, 270 is west.
